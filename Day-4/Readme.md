Question : Why is Helm important for managing configuration across different environments in a real-world product (e.g., dev, staging, prod)?

Answer : We can create environment specific configuration by using template and values files. This can help us to define separate config like values-dev.yaml or values-prod.yaml etc.
It also helps to reuse the same manifest files for all environment with difference in values.
Image tagging, replica count and resource limit can also be set according to the environment . It also ensures uniform deployment.

Example : 

helm install my-app -f values-prod.yaml ./my-app
helm install my-app -f values-dev.yaml ./my-app


Question : How does Helm simplify deployment rollback during a production incident?

Answer : Helm has built in versioning and roll back features for faster and safe recovery.
1. Every helm install or upgrade is stored as a release revision number
2. Rollback is faster due to release number
3. Helm history shows what changes are applied in past which gives better tracibility
4. Allows atomic rollback


helm upgrade my-app ./my-app-chart --set image.tag=v2.0.0

helm rollback my-app 1

It gives operational confidence during incidents resolution , it doesnt require manual rollback which reduce the time for resolution.
